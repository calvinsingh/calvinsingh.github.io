                     Regarding the code review practices I did on the last few days ago, it indicates that it desperately required be correcting and modifying. Advancing the code will make it easier and reliable to correct available errors in the future. The applicationâ€™s entails define the functions of classes and their methods, parameters, and return types. However, the contents depend much on the comments that I included within the code. It is easy to navigate the methods and functions of every class utilizing the codes created. That part of the code advancement in my crime reporting application and developed a java doc. 
                        
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    
                   In the time of code review, there were partially developed IF-ELSE statements in several classes within the program. They lacked the default cases. Besides, there were wrongly arranged TRY-CASH classes that lacked the appropriate codes within the CATCH block. For instance, some blocks were incomplete and some were even blank. Although those errors do not hinder the application program from executing, they often result in logical errors during run time. On the case of the catch clause, it is challenging to realize if a certain error takes place as there is no default case or message in the mentioned parts and appropriate messages in the targeted catch blocks.
                    
                    </p>
                    
                    
                    <p>
                    Thirdly, After taking some time checking on program packages, I identified that all classes and most of the functions have fewer or no documentation at all. Comments are useful in that they allow other programmers to understand the program more easily. Further during programming, it can also help the programmer debug his or her program more easily compared to non commented program. Therefore to enhance the project, I included comments in each function and at the top of every class I added comments that describe the function of the class and the methods that are to be expected in that class.
                    
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Lastly, the project also had some problems with method, class, and variable names. Having descriptive names enables the program to become simple to correct errors, make some updates, and easy to comprehend. Hence, I took the motive and added that enhancement. 
                    
                    </p>
                   
                </li>
                  
                  
                  
                  <li class="list-group-item" style="color: black">
                    
                 <h5 class="code_1">Achievement</h5>
                 <p>
                     
                     Those advancements made on the crime reporting application have enabled me to hone my application creation skills. I have a positive attitude and motivation that I can create a software project, which can be upgraded, debugged, and modified by my fellow programmers. Also, I can develop a project that uses descriptive methods and class names. I now finally possess sophisticated skills to develop a software project that has little logical bugs.

                 <p>
                     
                     I managed to work on all the planned enhancement on this part of the project.
