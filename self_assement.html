                 <p>

                 <h5 class="code_1">My Educational Journey</h5>
                   <p>
                     I began my journey with SNHU back in 2017, it was the best decision I made but at the time I was not so sure about. Little did I know it was going the one big adventure with a long journey ahead. I had gone to Saint Paul College for a year after graduating from high school, but I left to start up my own company. For the next two years I was able to build my company up, it was not an easy road, but I made it. After building the company up I had some time on my hand; I decided to go back to school. I didn’t know what I wanted to do or where I want to go but I wanted to get a degree and make to make my parents proud of me.
                     
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>

                    I didn’t know where to start but if not for my sister helping, I would have been lost. My sister has been attending SNHU since 2015 and was telling about her journey with SNHU and how happy she was with SNHU. She told me how the advisors made her feel like she belongs, and they cared about her future. She had convinced me; I saw her eye sparks when she talked about SNHU. I decided to give online school a chance and start my degree in Computer Science.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Starting my class was not an easy road and it made me want to quit before I even started. I just couldn’t handle everything being online since I have never done it before. But with the encouragement from my sister and her help I was able to make it through the first couple semesters. I learned to take it step by step and to manage my time!
                        
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>

                    I took time off to build my company up with my brothers and I was able to achieve that with hard work and never giving up hope. Three years ago, I made a decision to go back to school and I am glad that SNHU found me. It has been the best three years of my life; it came with hardship and days where I wanted to pull my hair out, but it was worth every second. Now I am going to be saying goodbye to this chapter of life in a couple weeks, but I can definitely say it was the best time of my life.

                 <h5 class="code_1">Program Reflection</h5>
                    <p>
                     
                     Throughout my time here at SNHU, I have learned about so many useful topics and skills, but a few stand out as the ones that I appreciate the most and feel are the most useful.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    One of the classes I really appreciated the most was CS-260, my Data Structures and Algorithms class. One of the most fun things to me is writing algorithms and throughout that course, I greatly expanded my knowledge on data structures and algorithms. It became clear to me how much both data structures and algorithms are deeply woven into programming and that programs would cease to function without them.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Without data structures to hold data, some programs would have thousands or millions of lines of code that would be difficult to build, harder to maintain, and almost impossible to debug. Having data structures avoids a lot of unnecessary and redundant coding and they are essential tools for any software developer to create even the simplest programs.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Algorithms are just as important as data structures, for saving time, reducing unnecessary lines of code, and making programs work. They are also very powerful, and some of the most complex and powerful algorithms are yet to be discovered.

                    With the right tools, I can create any program I set my mind to, and that course gave me a big step forward in attaining those tools.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>

                    Another very useful class moving forward was CS-310, the Collaboration and Group Project course. I didn’t even know what git was before starting that class, and it took me a minute to wrap my mind about it.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    From that class, I learned all about version control and how it is particularly useful when multiple people are working on the same project. With version control, the project is stored in a centralized location, and all team members are able to access the latest version whenever they are working on it, and they are able to merge their own work to the project as branches whenever they develop something new. This makes team collaboration much more seamless and there aren’t many different versions of the project floating around on each team member’s computer.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Another benefit of version control that is incredibly useful is that a detailed history and changelog is kept, and the project is able to be reverted back to an old version at any time if such a thing becomes necessary. Sometimes features don’t work quite as intended, or they are just deemed unnecessary. Reverting to a version without these changes can be much easier than combing through lines of code trying to remove the change manually.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    This class helped me expand and recall my Git skills by forcing me to upload all of my projects to GitHub, and it was a good reminder of just how convenient using a platform like GitHub can be...
                    
                    </p>
                
                </li>
                  
                  
                <li class="list-group-item" style="color: black">
                    
                 <h5 class="code_1">Final Portfolio Summary</h5>
                    
                 <p>
                 For this project, I chose artifact that I had created earlier. I named it Academic Report generator, I developed this project from scratch. I used JavaFX, Java, CSS and SQLite database. The objective of creating this application was to perfect my skills in Desktop application development, though it went beyond that, since during the development I found out that it could be helpful to others and therefore I made sure that i have created all what is needed to make the application run on different platforms like windows and Linux. Java Documentation on the web and knowledge from Computer science Program enabled me to achieve everything in this Desktop Application.
                    
                 </p>
                    
                <p>
                    
                After my code review classes, I found out that, beside the application running without syntax errors and or logical errors, there are some other programming designs, coding rules , data structures and algorithms etc. that need to be enhanced further to make the project codes more readable, easy to debug and also make the project more powerful and reliable.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    
                   For the software design and engineering part of the project, I found a lot that needs to be enhanced. The project lacks enough documentation which makes it difficult to debug and read, secondly, the project has incomplete IF-ELSE statements and try-catch blocks without exception messages. Furthermore, the application failed to follow the basic java standards rules of coding.<br/> 
                  Therefore to enhance the application, I will use my knowledge from computer science program and other previous knowledge to correct and correct all the selected areas above.
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    
                For the algorithms and data structures portion of the project, I found out several weaknesses in the code that actually caused the application to freeze during run time, which makes the application to take a lot of time at start up and also very times one opens the activity window. From my view, I checked and confirmed that some algorithms and data structures which are not suitable had been used.
                    
                
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    Therefore to enhance the application I used my knowledge and some Internet resources to obtain the most suitable data structures and algorithms to use. This included searching algorithms, use of array list and other java data structures.
                </p>

                <p>
                For the databases portion of the final project, there were some changes which needs to be done, instead of using a file based database, SQLite, I propose to use a web based database so that the app can support data sharing. Further it will secure the data and also back up of students data will be carried out easily.
                </p>

               <p>
                   
                   To achieve the above task I selected the best SQL Database hosting services to create and host my database for the application. The most challenging part at this point was to get a hosting site which is reliable, affordable and also support all the services for connecting the database remotely.
