                   <p>
                     My academic journey started in 2017 at Florida College, which was among the best decisions I ever made. After graduating from the college, I initiated my company before joining back to school to pursue a bachelor’s degree. The journey was challenging but through my brother’s assistance, I managed. 
                     
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>

                 He advised me to consider online classes and decided to get an opportunity to listen. I started my degree in computer science through online platform. Though it was not easy, I managed to pursue it and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in data structure and algorithms. From school, I developed my company even further with my brother’s support. Having completed the computer science degree, I open a new life in the business field and prosper.

                    <p>
                     
                     Throughout my time here at SNHU, I have learned about so many useful topics and skills, but a few stand out as the ones that I appreciate the most and feel are the most useful.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                   I have learned many effective topics, concepts, and skills throughout my academic period in Florida University. The most interesting class in the course was the CS-260, which focuses on data structures and algorithms. It helped me improve my knowledge on data structures and algorithms, which allowed me to extensively understand the concept. 

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                   Data structures are comprehensively related to programming concepts and I learned that a program without appropriate data structure and algorithms would stop functioning. It helps reducing redundant and unnecessary coding when developing software. The next concept learned was about the Git, which incorporates versions control and how it is certain helpful when several individuals are working on a similar project. As a result, I improved and recalled my new gained Git skills through uploading all my projects to GitHub.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Algorithms are just as important as data structures, for saving time, reducing unnecessary lines of code, and making programs work. They are also very powerful, and some of the most complex and powerful algorithms are yet to be discovered.

                    With the right tools, I can create any program I set my mind to, and that course gave me a big step forward in attaining those tools.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>

                    Another very useful class moving forward was CS-310, the Collaboration and Group Project course. I didn’t even know what git was before starting that class, and it took me a minute to wrap my mind about it.

                    </p>
                    
                   
                    <p>
                    This class helped me expand and recall my Git skills by forcing me to upload all of my projects to GitHub, and it was a good reminder of just how convenient using a platform like GitHub can be...

                 <p>
                The crime reporting application is a simple software that helps the public in the reporting of criminal activities. The general objective is to allow the public to report activates anonymously easily and in real-time. When an individual reports a criminal activity, the record is stored, and another person can view when a need arises. Once a reported crime activity is deleted, the application updates the records. The users can also view the reported crime activities, post, and comment on the reported criminal activities. Also, the users can chat with each other concerning the criminal activities reported and other relevant information. I have chosen this artefact as I partially created it in a prerequisite program to test my java skills.
                    
                 </p>
                    
                <p>
                    
               The enhancements area include the data structure and algorithms, database, and design part. Performing those enhance on the code will make it easier and reliable to correct available errors in the future (MacLeod et al., 2017). 
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    
                   For the software design and engineering part of the project, 

                  There were partially developed IF-ELSE statements in several classes within the program. They lacked the default cases. Besides, there were wrongly arranged TRY-CASH classes that lacked the appropriate codes within the CATCH block. For instance, some blocks were incomplete, and some were even blank. Although those errors do not hinder the application program from executing, they often result in logical errors during run time. In the catch clause, it is challenging to realize if a certain error takes place as there is no default case or message in the mentioned parts and appropriate messages in the targeted catch blocks (Heckman& King, 2018).
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    
                For the algorithms and data structures portion of the project,
                 I delineated some of the weaknesses resulting from using unsuitable data structures and algorithms on the data structure and algorithms. Firstly, the crime report application freezes when a user posts a criminal activity. It resulted from the large amount of data retrieved from the database at the beginning and loaded on the main view module. Furthermore, the application lacked an appropriate algorithm applied in the project to create search forms for the crime activities' details. 
                    
                
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    To improve the project, I rectified the initial weakness relating to application freezing at startup. To enable useful functionality, I developed an Array List to hold the data from the data. The data being stored is further used to create the only amount of the forms required to be displayed in the main module (Wei et al., 2020). The forms are held in a VBox layout where a scroll pane is utilized to hold the layout to enable scrolling to allow users to see all forms. At the end of the first form batch, I added a button to add another similar amount of forms of each data in the Array List. Since only ten forms are retrieved at startup, the freezing of the application was eliminated.
                </p>

                <p>
                On the database enhancement, the first weakness is that the crime report application database connection mechanism. To connect the crime application to the database, it included a different language like PHP. When using different programming language, it makes the connection complex and incompatible with its functions. Another weakness is that the database was hosted locally, which limited the accessibility to various users of the crime application.
                </p>

               <p>
                   
                  To improve the software, I corrected the initial weakness by using the popular Java Database connectivity approach (JDBC), which is easy and utilizes a single programing language; java. Using the JDBC approach, the connection becomes simple with a single file that holds the java connection codes rather than multiple files of different programming language codes (Tribhuvan, 2020). The other improvement involved hosting the database into a remote server, which enables multiple access by various users. Also, through remote server hosting, data retrieval and data transmission are smooth and take less execution time, unlike the local server hosting technique.
                   
               </p>

               	In conclusion, those enhancements on data structure and algorithms, database, and software design have enabled the artefact to satisfy user requirements and meet its objectives completely. The application now enables universal database accessibility and takes less execution time to load and display crime activity details, unlike the previous application. Data searching algorithm is now quick and easy. The application currently does not freeze at users' crime activity posting.

               <p>
