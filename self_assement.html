                 <h5 class="code_1">My Educational Journey</h5>
                   <p>
                     I began my journey with SNHU back in 2017, it was the best decision I made but at the time I was not so sure about. Little did I know it was going the one big adventure with a long journey ahead. I had gone to Saint Paul College for a year after graduating from high school, but I left to start up my own company. For the next two years I was able to build my company up, it was not an easy road, but I made it. After building the company up I had some time on my hand; I decided to go back to school. I didn’t know what I wanted to do or where I want to go but I wanted to get a degree and make to make my parents proud of me.
                     
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>

                    I didn’t know where to start but if not for my sister helping, I would have been lost. My sister has been attending SNHU since 2015 and was telling about her journey with SNHU and how happy she was with SNHU. She told me how the advisors made her feel like she belongs, and they cared about her future. She had convinced me; I saw her eye sparks when she talked about SNHU. I decided to give online school a chance and start my degree in Computer Science.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Starting my class was not an easy road and it made me want to quit before I even started. I just couldn’t handle everything being online since I have never done it before. But with the encouragement from my sister and her help I was able to make it through the first couple semesters. I learned to take it step by step and to manage my time!
                        
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>

                    I took time off to build my company up with my brothers and I was able to achieve that with hard work and never giving up hope. Three years ago, I made a decision to go back to school and I am glad that SNHU found me. It has been the best three years of my life; it came with hardship and days where I wanted to pull my hair out, but it was worth every second. Now I am going to be saying goodbye to this chapter of life in a couple weeks, but I can definitely say it was the best time of my life.

                    <p>
                     
                     Throughout my time here at SNHU, I have learned about so many useful topics and skills, but a few stand out as the ones that I appreciate the most and feel are the most useful.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    One of the classes I really appreciated the most was CS-260, my Data Structures and Algorithms class. One of the most fun things to me is writing algorithms and throughout that course, I greatly expanded my knowledge on data structures and algorithms. It became clear to me how much both data structures and algorithms are deeply woven into programming and that programs would cease to function without them.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Without data structures to hold data, some programs would have thousands or millions of lines of code that would be difficult to build, harder to maintain, and almost impossible to debug. Having data structures avoids a lot of unnecessary and redundant coding and they are essential tools for any software developer to create even the simplest programs.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Algorithms are just as important as data structures, for saving time, reducing unnecessary lines of code, and making programs work. They are also very powerful, and some of the most complex and powerful algorithms are yet to be discovered.

                    With the right tools, I can create any program I set my mind to, and that course gave me a big step forward in attaining those tools.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>

                    Another very useful class moving forward was CS-310, the Collaboration and Group Project course. I didn’t even know what git was before starting that class, and it took me a minute to wrap my mind about it.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    From that class, I learned all about version control and how it is particularly useful when multiple people are working on the same project. With version control, the project is stored in a centralized location, and all team members are able to access the latest version whenever they are working on it, and they are able to merge their own work to the project as branches whenever they develop something new. This makes team collaboration much more seamless and there aren’t many different versions of the project floating around on each team member’s computer.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Another benefit of version control that is incredibly useful is that a detailed history and changelog is kept, and the project is able to be reverted back to an old version at any time if such a thing becomes necessary. Sometimes features don’t work quite as intended, or they are just deemed unnecessary. Reverting to a version without these changes can be much easier than combing through lines of code trying to remove the change manually.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    This class helped me expand and recall my Git skills by forcing me to upload all of my projects to GitHub, and it was a good reminder of just how convenient using a platform like GitHub can be...

                 <h5 class="code_1">Final Portfolio Summary</h5>
                    
                 <p>
                The crime reporting application is a simple software that helps the public in the reporting of criminal activities. The general objective is to allow the public to report activates anonymously easily and in real-time. When an individual reports a criminal activity, the record is stored, and another person can view when a need arises. Once a reported crime activity is deleted, the application updates the records. The users can also view the reported crime activities, post, and comment on the reported criminal activities. Also, the users can chat with each other concerning the criminal activities reported and other relevant information. I have chosen this artefact as I partially created it in a prerequisite program to test my java skills.
                    
                 </p>
                    
                <p>
                    
               The enhancements area include the data structure and algorithms, database, and design part. Performing those enhance on the code will make it easier and reliable to correct available errors in the future (MacLeod et al., 2017). 
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    
                   For the software design and engineering part of the project, 

                  There were partially developed IF-ELSE statements in several classes within the program. They lacked the default cases. Besides, there were wrongly arranged TRY-CASH classes that lacked the appropriate codes within the CATCH block. For instance, some blocks were incomplete, and some were even blank. Although those errors do not hinder the application program from executing, they often result in logical errors during run time. In the catch clause, it is challenging to realize if a certain error takes place as there is no default case or message in the mentioned parts and appropriate messages in the targeted catch blocks (Heckman& King, 2018).
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    
                For the algorithms and data structures portion of the project,
                 I delineated some of the weaknesses resulting from using unsuitable data structures and algorithms on the data structure and algorithms. Firstly, the crime report application freezes when a user posts a criminal activity. It resulted from the large amount of data retrieved from the database at the beginning and loaded on the main view module. Furthermore, the application lacked an appropriate algorithm applied in the project to create search forms for the crime activities' details. 
                    
                
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    To improve the project, I rectified the initial weakness relating to application freezing at startup. To enable useful functionality, I developed an Array List to hold the data from the data. The data being stored is further used to create the only amount of the forms required to be displayed in the main module (Wei et al., 2020). The forms are held in a VBox layout where a scroll pane is utilized to hold the layout to enable scrolling to allow users to see all forms. At the end of the first form batch, I added a button to add another similar amount of forms of each data in the Array List. Since only ten forms are retrieved at startup, the freezing of the application was eliminated.
                </p>

                <p>
                On the database enhancement, the first weakness is that the crime report application database connection mechanism. To connect the crime application to the database, it included a different language like PHP. When using different programming language, it makes the connection complex and incompatible with its functions. Another weakness is that the database was hosted locally, which limited the accessibility to various users of the crime application.
                </p>

               <p>
                   
                  To improve the software, I corrected the initial weakness by using the popular Java Database connectivity approach (JDBC), which is easy and utilizes a single programing language; java. Using the JDBC approach, the connection becomes simple with a single file that holds the java connection codes rather than multiple files of different programming language codes (Tribhuvan, 2020). The other improvement involved hosting the database into a remote server, which enables multiple access by various users. Also, through remote server hosting, data retrieval and data transmission are smooth and take less execution time, unlike the local server hosting technique.
                   
               </p>

               	In conclusion, those enhancements on data structure and algorithms, database, and software design have enabled the artefact to satisfy user requirements and meet its objectives completely. The application now enables universal database accessibility and takes less execution time to load and display crime activity details, unlike the previous application. Data searching algorithm is now quick and easy. The application currently does not freeze at users' crime activity posting.

               <p>
