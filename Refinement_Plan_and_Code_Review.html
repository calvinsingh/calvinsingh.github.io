                     After my code review classes, I found out that, beside the application running without syntax errors and or logical errors, there are some other programming designs, coding rules , data structures and algorithms etc. that need to be enhanced further to make the project codes more readable, easy to debug and also make the project more powerful and reliable.

                     <br>
                     The below paragraphs explain each result found and how it was a weakness to the whole application
                        
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    

                      There were partially developed IF-ELSE statements in several classes within the program. They lacked the default cases. Besides, there were wrongly arranged TRY-CASH classes that lacked the appropriate codes within the CATCH block. For instance, some blocks were incomplete, and some were even blank. Although those errors do not hinder the application program from executing, they often result in logical errors during run time. In the catch clause, it is challenging to realize if a certain error takes place as there is no default case or message in the mentioned parts and appropriate messages in the targeted catch blocks (Heckman& King, 2018).
                    
                    </p>
                   
                </li>
                  
                  
                <li class="list-group-item" style="color: black">
                    
                 <h5 class="code_1">Algorithms and Data Structures</h5>
                 <h5>Code Review Results</h5>
                 <p>
                     
                    I delineated some of the weaknesses resulting from using unsuitable data structures and algorithms on the data structure and algorithms. Firstly, the crime report application freezes when a user posts a criminal activity. It resulted from the large amount of data retrieved from the database at the beginning and loaded on the main view module. Furthermore, the application lacked an appropriate algorithm applied in the project to create search forms for the crime activities' details. 
                    
                 </p>
                    
                    
                <p>
                  
                  To improve the project, I rectified the initial weakness relating to application freezing at startup. To enable useful functionality, I developed an Array List to hold the data from the data. The data being stored is further used to create the only amount of the forms required to be displayed in the main module (Wei et al., 2020). The forms are held in a VBox layout where a scroll pane is utilized to hold the layout to enable scrolling to allow users to see all forms. At the end of the first form batch, I added a button to add another similar amount of forms of each data in the Array List. Since only ten forms are retrieved at startup, the freezing of the application was eliminated.
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                  
                  Secondly, the application had a problem relating to searching the reported crime activities and further details such as the location and type of crime. The searching for the reported crime activities was among the objectives to create the project. Retrieving and displaying data must be easy and quick. On the previous application, users can search for the data. Conversely, due to the weak algorithms applied, the data fetched, and the execution time during display of the data fails to meet the application objectives and requirements. To rectify that, I initiated a searching algorithm when fetches all necessary data from the database, filtering it and displaying it to the users.

                 <h5 class="code_1">Databases</h5>
                 <p>
                     
                     On the database enhancement, the first weakness is that the crime report application database connection mechanism. To connect the crime application to the database, it included a different language like PHP. When using different programming language, it makes the connection complex and incompatible with its functions. Another weakness is that the database was hosted locally, which limited the accessibility to various users of the crime application.
                    
                 </p>
                    
                    
                <p>
                    
                   To improve the software, I corrected the initial weakness by using the popular Java Database connectivity approach (JDBC), which is easy and utilizes a single programing language; java. Using the JDBC approach, the connection becomes simple with a single file that holds the java connection codes rather than multiple files of different programming language codes (Tribhuvan, 2020). The other improvement involved hosting the database into a remote server, which enables multiple access by various users. Also, through remote server hosting, data retrieval and data transmission are smooth and take less execution time, unlike the local server hosting technique.
